# Aim:To reduce time traffic and time to find parking place in mall or street on google map

We propose an effective CNN architecture for visual parking occupancy detection.

•
The CNN architecture is small enough to run on smart cameras.

•
The proposed solution performs and generalizes better than other SotA approaches.

•
We provide a new training/validation dataset for parking occupancy detection.
